# User Authentication System

This project is part of my Full Stack Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech. The task involves implementing a user authentication system with secure login and registration functionality. The system ensures that users can sign up for an account, log in securely, and access protected routes only after successful authentication. Additionally, it incorporates standard mechanisms for password hashing, session management.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create a new account by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.
- **Secure Login**: Users can log in using their credentials. Passwords are securely hashed before storage.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are managed to keep users logged in and maintain state.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.


## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MySQL**: SQL database for storing user information.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords securely.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashrao0001/PRODIGY_FS_01.git
   cd PRODIGY_FS_01
